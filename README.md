# PROJECT:JUNK FILE ORGANIZER


By--Akshayan ks

## Aim:

The aim of this project is to build a python program that runs as a command-line tool. Basically,
as a lazy programmer, my desktop is full of files as shown below. Due to a large number of files,
it is a daunting task to sit and organize each file. To make that task easy, we need a Python script that
comes in handy and returns a folder where all the files are organized in a well-manner within seconds.
It should organize by size, last used or even extensions. 


## Approach for Junk File Organizer using python Python :

1.Using OS module - OS module in python provides functions for interacting with the operating system and 
also enables access to the file extensions , size of the file and create new directories and move files into them . 
2. Create Dictionaries: A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed
3. Mapping: Now we will map the file formats with directory.
4. Organizing:  It will organize everything in appropriate folder .


## Result :
At one step all the junk files prescribed in the dictionaries are arranged and moved automatically to the new
folder as coded to the dictionaries. The junk file organizing work is automatically done using python.
